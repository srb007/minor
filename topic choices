Dear members,

This is to inform all of you that you have to make a informal synopsys of the topics that you want to pursue in the minor 
project.
And upload them when you think feasible before or on 28th january.
We will not talk about postponding the schedules in college.
if you want to discuss anything,write in the same file.Consequently,the decisions will be taken by all the members.

@TusharSharma.

First of all,spelling of synopsis is wrong ,Secondly,There is no world called postponding in English Grammar.
Thirdly,Github is not a place to discuss idea's.
If one has to discuss idea's it is better to discuss idea's face to face like all real world discussions .
So please stop this kind of behaviour and before making any decision kindly ask other group members if they agree to what you want.
It will better if you follow the above written comments.
